# LearningUnrealProj
 Learning Unreal Engine through making my own FPS game. Built in a combination of blueprints and C++. This project will consist of assests from the unreal marketplace as I will not be making the assets. The focus of this is to learn the ins and outs of the engine. Builds upon my week 1-4 repo's I have.
